cvsweb version 1.0

cvsweb is a WWW CGI script that allows remote access to a CVS tree.  It
allows browsing of the full tree; no access controls are implemented.
It can display the revision history of a file, as well as diffs between
revisions and downloading the whole file.

The configuration should be easy; edit the variable definitions at the
top, above the line that says "End configuration section".  Then install
it in your web server's cgi-bin directory and you should be all set.

Several people have approaced me about modifying cvsweb for their own
needs.  I would ask that if you make a useful modification, that you send
it back to me for inclusion in the next release.
